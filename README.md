# Welcome to my Coding Explorations!

Welcome to my collection of coding experiments, projects, and technical explorations. This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through different technologies, programming concepts, and creative solutions to interesting problems.

Each project here represents a learning opportunity, a technical challenge, or simply an idea I wanted to bring to life. Feel free to explore, learn from, or build upon anything you find useful.

### [THE BIRDY GAME](https://ajdesignb.github.io/MM621_F25/project_1_Birdy/index.html)

## About the Game

An exploration of randomness through interactive gameplay—my own somewhat broken version of Flappy Bird.

This project examines how randomness shapes user experience through unpredictable obstacles, varying difficulties, and emergent gameplay moments. Built as an interactive randomizer, the game transforms chaos and uncertainty into a minute-long challenge where player input meets algorithmic unpredictability.

The experience features randomized pipe heights, spacing, and timing that create unique sessions with each playthrough. Through deliberate design choices in mapping, feedback, signifiers, and affordances, the game explores the tension between player control and system-generated chaos.

**Note:** This is one of my early explorations in interactive design and game development. As I'm still learning, this version intentionally retains its quirks and "broken" elements as part of the creative process.
