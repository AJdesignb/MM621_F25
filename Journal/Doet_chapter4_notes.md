# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 4 : Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback (PG 125 - 141)

### 1. Knowledge in the WORLD vs. Knowledge in the HEAD

**Knowledge in the Head**
Information that’s **memorized or learned**, things you already know from experience, training, or logic.

> Examples:
> 1. Knowing that red means stop.
> 2. Remembering your phone's unlock code.
> 3. Knowing how to ride a bike _(procedural memory)_

**Adavntages:** Quick once learned, no need for external aids.
**Disavantages:** Requires memory and practice; errors occur if you forget or misremember.

**Knowledge in the WORLD**
Information **built into the environment** or object itself, visible cues that remind or guide users.

> Examples:
> 1. A “push” label on a door.
> 2. A knob that clearly controls a burner in the same position.
> 3. A light that shows a device is on.

**Advantages:** Reduces memory load; helps new or infrequent users.
**Disadvantages:** Can clutter the design; users may become dependent on visual prompts.

***Good design balances both — enough knowledge in the world to help people act correctly, but not so much clutter that it’s overwhelming.
When designs are intuitive, users rely less on memory and more on natural cues.***

### 2. Four kinds of CONSTRAINTS

Constraints help narrow down possible actions and guide correct behavior. Norman identifies four types:

**1. PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS:** 
The physical shape or structure limits what actions are possible.

> EXAMPLES:
> A USB plug fits only one way
> Lego bricks connect only via studs.
