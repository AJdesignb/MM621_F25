# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

**Knowledge in the Head**
Information that’s **memorized or learned**, things you already know from experience, training, or logic.

> Examples:
> 1. Knowing that red means stop.
> 2. Remembering your phone's unlock code.

> Examples:
> 1. A “push” label on a door.
> 2. A knob that clearly controls a burner in the same position.
> 3. A light that shows a device is on.
