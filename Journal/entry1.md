# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 1 : The Psychopathalogy of Everyday Things

Chapter one talks about how poor design in everyday objects can create a lot of unnecessary frustration. A Good design is  are products that are a balanced combination of visible signinifiers, clear affordances, natural mapping, built-in constraints and proper feedback.

> The example of the comparison between the complex telephone system and the author's car was a fun example that clearly explained that if things are visible, have good mappings, natural relationships, between the controls and the things controlled, there is good feedback. The system is understandable. And in General, the relationship among the user's intentions, the required actions, and the results are sensible, nonarbitrary, and meaningful then that is a good design. (Pg 22. DOET)

#### A few terms that I learnt:

**Visibility** : 
> The correct parts must be visible, and they must convey the correct message. (Pg 4. DOET)
> Visibility indicates the mapping between intended actions and actual Operations. It indicates crucial distinctions. (Pg 8. DOET)
***e.g. The door example, Flat plate for pushing and handle for pulling.***
               
**Affordances** : 
Objects should make their possible actions obvious. ***chair eg***
> When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction is required. Comples things may require explanation, but simple things should not. When simple things need pictures, labels or instructions, _the design has failed_ (pg. 9 DOET)

**Constraints** :
Design should guide the user toward correct behavior by making wrong actions impossible or unlikely.

**Conceptual Models**
A conceptual model is a simplified mental picture of how something works, formed by the user based on their interaction with it.

1. Providing a good conceptual Model
2. Making things visible
