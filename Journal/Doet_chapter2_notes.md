# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 2 : The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Norman explores why people do what they do when using everyday things — and why they often fail.
He breaks down human interaction into stages of action, discusses common errors, and shows how good design supports the human cognitive process.

### 1. The Seven Stages of Action:

When a person interacts with the world, their behavior follows a psychological loop:

**The Stages of Execution**
1. Forming the goal — deciding what to achieve.
2. Forming the intention — deciding how to do it.
3. Specifying the action — deciding what specific steps to take.
4. Executing the action — carrying them out.

**The Stages of Evaluation**
5. Perceiving the system state — noticing what happened.
6. Interpreting the system state - understanging what it means
7. Evaluating the outcome — comparing to the goal.

Together, they create a **feedback cycle**:

***Goal → Intention → Action → Feedback → Evaluation → New Goal***

### 2. Two Key Concepts: THE GULFS

**Gulf of Execution** - The gap between what the user wants to do and what actions the system allows.
> Example: A confusing remote control where it’s unclear which button starts the DVD.

**Gulf of Evaluation** - The gap between what actually happened and how easily the user can interpret it.
> Example: Pressing a button and not knowing if the device turned on because there’s no light or sound feedback.

> Example: THE REFRIGERATOR & FREEZER
> 
> Norman describes a refrigerator with two compartments and two temperature controls, but no clear mapping between them.
>
> - Users often think one control is for the refrigerator and one for the freezer — but both actually affect both compartments.
> - Result: confusion, overcompensation, and frustration.
> 
> Lesson: The system’s design should reflect the mental model users are likely to have.

### 3. Knowledge in the HEAD vs. Knowledge in the WORLD

**Knowledge in the head** → what users must remember (_e.g., password, sequence, procedure_).
**Knowledge in the world** → what the design makes visible (_e.g., labels, shapes, affordances_).

> Example: TELEPHONES (Old vs. New)
> 
> Norman discusses telephones with memory buttons:
> 
> - Early users forgot to store numbers or how to use memory functions — they didn’t match users’ conceptual models.
> - Simple design cues (_like “M+” or “Store” buttons labeled clearly_) would have helped.
> 
> Lesson: users shouldn’t need a manual for simple actions.

### 4. Memory and the World as an EXTERNAL MIND

People use the environment to remember:
Lists, sticky notes, and physical arrangements serve as external memory aids.
> Example: leaving an object by the door as a reminder to take it with you.

Designers can support this by making ***information visible at the right time.***

### 5. SLIPS vs. MISTAKES

**Slips → Right intention, wrong action.**
Often occur during routine behavior or distractions.
> Example: Typing “teh” instead of “the”, or turning the wrong stove knob.

**Types of slips:**
1. Capture errors – a frequent action takes over a less frequent one (_e.g., driving to work instead of the store_).
2. Description errors – acting on the wrong object that’s similar (_e.g., throwing dirty clothes in the toilet instead of the hamper_).
3. Data-driven errors – external stimuli influence your action (_e.g., dialing numbers from an ad while meaning to call a friend_).
4. Associative activation errors – internal thoughts trigger wrong actions (_e.g., saying “You too” to a waiter saying “Enjoy your meal”_).
5. Loss-of-activation errors – forgetting what you were doing mid-task.
6. Mode errors – same control does different things in different modes (_e.g., hitting “Delete” in the wrong app mode_).

**Mistakes → Wrong goal or plan.**
Caused by incorrect understanding or faulty reasoning.
> Example: Adjusting the refrigerator’s “freezer” dial to make the fridge colder, not realizing the controls are linked.

***Design should prevent both slips and mistakes*** through clear mapping, constraints, and feedback.

> Example: THE STOVE PROBLEM
> 
> A stovetop with four burners and four identical knobs, but no clear mapping.
> 
> - Users can’t tell which knob controls which burner.
> - Good design uses spatial mapping (_arranging controls in the same pattern as burners_).
> 
>Lesson: Mapping must match the user’s mental model.

### 6. FEEDBACK and VISIBILITY

Feedback answers:
_“Did it work?”
 “What happened?”
 “What should I do next?”_

> Examples:
Clicking a light switch and seeing the light turn on (_clear feedback_).
Pressing a computer button with no visible result (_poor feedback_).

Feedback should be:
- Immediate
- Perceptible
- Relevant
- Not overwhelming (_too much feedback causes noise and confusion_)

> Example: DOORS
> 
> Norman references “Norman Doors” — doors that are confusing to open because their affordances and signifiers don’t match the intended action.
> - A flat metal plate affords pushing, but if you must pull it, that’s bad design.
> - A pull handle signifies pulling.
>
> Lesson: Visibility and signifiers are essential for discoverability.

### 7. EVALUATING ACTIONS & OUTCOMES

After acting, users check whether the result matches their goal:
- Good systems show status information (_progress bars, lights, indicators_).
- Without it, users feel uncertain or repeat actions unnecessarily (_“Did it register?”_).

Norman links this to **the feedback loop** — the smoother the loop, the better the design.

### 8. Using the SEVEN STAGES as a DESIGN FRAMEWORK

Designers can use these stages as a usability checklist:
1. Does the user form the right goal?
2. Is it clear what actions are possible?
3. Is the mapping between controls and outcomes natural?
4. Is feedback immediate and understandable?
5. Can users easily evaluate success?

### 9. DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

- Make actions **visible** and **intuitive.**
- Provide **clear, immediate feedback.**
- Use **natural mappings** between control and result.
- Support both **knowledge in the world** and **knowledge in the head.**
- Minimize **gulfs** of execution and evaluation.
- Anticipate and design against **slips and mistakes.**
- Support **error recovery**, make undo easy.

## _“When the number of possible actions is large, the design challenge is to make clear what actions are possible and how they should be done.”_
