# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 2 : The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Norman explores why people do what they do when using everyday things — and why they often fail.
He breaks down human interaction into stages of action, discusses common errors, and shows how good design supports the human cognitive process.

### 1. The Seven Stages of Action:

When a person interacts with the world, their behavior follows a psychological loop:

**The Stages of Execution**
1. Forming the goal — deciding what to achieve.
2. Forming the intention — deciding how to do it.
3. Specifying the action — deciding what specific steps to take.
4. Executing the action — carrying them out.

**The Stages of Evaluation**
5. Perceiving the system state — noticing what happened.
6. Interpreting the system state - understanging what it means
7. Evaluating the outcome — comparing to the goal.

Together, they create a **feedback cycle**:

***Goal → Intention → Action → Feedback → Evaluation → New Goal***

### 2. Two Key Concepts: THE GULFS

**Gulf of Execution** - The gap between what the user wants to do and what actions the system allows.
> Example: A confusing remote control where it’s unclear which button starts the DVD.

**Gulf of Evaluation** - The gap between what actually happened and how easily the user can interpret it.
> Example: Pressing a button and not knowing if the device turned on because there’s no light or sound feedback.

> Example: THE REFRIGERATOR & FREEZER
> Norman describes a refrigerator with two compartments and two temperature controls, but no clear mapping between them.
>
> Users often think one control is for the refrigerator and one for the freezer — but both actually affect both compartments.
> Result: confusion, overcompensation, and frustration.
> Lesson: The system’s design should reflect the mental model users are likely to have.

### 3. Knowledge in the Head vs. Knowledge in the World

**Knowledge in the head** → what users must remember (e.g., password, sequence, procedure).
**Knowledge in the world** → what the design makes visible (e.g., labels, shapes, affordances).

> Example: TELEPHONES (Old vs. New)
> Norman discusses telephones with memory buttons:
> 
> Early users forgot to store numbers or how to use memory functions — they didn’t match users’ conceptual models.
> Simple design cues (like “M+” or “Store” buttons labeled clearly) would have helped.
> Lesson: users shouldn’t need a manual for simple actions.

### 4. Memory and the World as an External Mind

People use the environment to remember:
Lists, sticky notes, and physical arrangements serve as external memory aids.
> Example: leaving an object by the door as a reminder to take it with you.

Designers can support this by making ***information visible at the right time.***

### 5. Slips vs. Mistakes

**Slips → Right intention, wrong action.**
Often occur during routine behavior or distractions.
> Example: Typing “teh” instead of “the”, or turning the wrong stove knob.

**Types of slips:**
1. Capture errors – a frequent action takes over a less frequent one (e.g., driving to work instead of the store).
2. Description errors – acting on the wrong object that’s similar (e.g., throwing dirty clothes in the toilet instead of the hamper).
3. Data-driven errors – external stimuli influence your action (e.g., dialing numbers from an ad while meaning to call a friend).
4. Associative activation errors – internal thoughts trigger wrong actions (e.g., saying “You too” to a waiter saying “Enjoy your meal”).
5. Loss-of-activation errors – forgetting what you were doing mid-task.
6. Mode errors – same control does different things in different modes (e.g., hitting “Delete” in the wrong app mode).

**Mistakes → Wrong goal or plan.**
Caused by incorrect understanding or faulty reasoning.
> Example: Adjusting the refrigerator’s “freezer” dial to make the fridge colder, not realizing the controls are linked.
