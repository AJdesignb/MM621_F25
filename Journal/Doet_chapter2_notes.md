# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 2 : The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Norman explores why people do what they do when using everyday things — and why they often fail.
He breaks down human interaction into stages of action, discusses common errors, and shows how good design supports the human cognitive process.

### 1. The Seven Stages of Action:

When a person interacts with the world, their behavior follows a psychological loop:

**The Stages of Execution**
1. Forming the goal — deciding what to achieve.
2. Forming the intention — deciding how to do it.
3. Specifying the action — deciding what specific steps to take.
4. Executing the action — carrying them out.

**The Stages of Evaluation**
5. Perceiving the system state — noticing what happened.
6. Interpreting the system state - understanging what it means
7. Evaluating the outcome — comparing to the goal.

Together, they create a **feedback cycle**:

***Goal → Intention → Action → Feedback → Evaluation → New Goal***

### 2. Two Key Concepts: THE GULFS

**Gulf of Execution** - The gap between what the user wants to do and what actions the system allows.
> Example: A confusing remote control where it’s unclear which button starts the DVD.

**Gulf of Evaluation** - The gap between what actually happened and how easily the user can interpret it.
