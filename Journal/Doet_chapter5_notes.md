# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 5 : Human Error? No, Bad Design 

The chapter argues that what is often blamed as “user error” is actually a failure of design.
It examines why people make errors (slips vs. mistakes), how errors arise in interaction with machines/systems, and what designers can do to reduce them. It also discusses automation issues, reporting/learning from error, and how design should anticipate human behaviour rather than assume perfect operation.

### Why errors occur?
**Humans have limitations:** attention lapses, memory limits, distraction, fatigue.
Machines & systems often require people to act in unnatural, non-intuitive ways; when the mental model of the human and machine diverges, errors are more likely.
Investigations of accidents often stop at “human error” without exploring deeper root causes which is design, system architecture, organisational issues.
