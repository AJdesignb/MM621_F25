# My notes on THE DESIGN OF EVERYDAY THINGS by DONALD A. NORMAN

## Chapter 5 : Human Error? No, Bad Design 

The chapter argues that what is often blamed as “user error” is actually a failure of design.
It examines why people make errors (slips vs. mistakes), how errors arise in interaction with machines/systems, and what designers can do to reduce them. It also discusses automation issues, reporting/learning from error, and how design should anticipate human behaviour rather than assume perfect operation.

### Why errors occur?

**Humans have limitations:** attention lapses, memory limits, distraction, fatigue.

Machines & systems often require people to act in unnatural, non-intuitive ways; when the mental model of the human and machine diverges, errors are more likely.

Investigations of accidents often stop at “human error” without exploring deeper root causes which is design, system architecture, organisational issues.

### Types of errors: **Slips** vs **Mistakes**

**SLIPS:**
The user’s intention is correct, but the execution is wrong _(e.g., pushing the wrong button, mis-clicking)_

There are 6 attributes

**a. Capture Errors:**
A more frequent or well-practiced activity “captures” your attention and overrides the intended one.
You start doing the correct sequence but drift into another familiar pattern.
**Example:** You intend to drive to the store but end up on your usual route to work instead.
Happens because routine behavior is executed automatically unless actively monitored.

**b. Description Similarity Errors**
You act on an item that looks or sounds like the correct one.
**Example:** Pouring orange juice into cereal instead of milk because both are in similar cartons, or clicking the wrong icon because two buttons look alike.
**Design takeaway:** Reduce visual similarity or increase distinctiveness between possible targets.

**c. Mode Errors:**
Occur when a system has multiple modes _(states in which the same control does different things)._
The user performs an action that’s appropriate for one mode but the system is in another.
**Example:** Pressing “Delete” thinking you’re deleting text, but the computer is in “command mode” and deletes the entire file.
**Design takeaway:** Minimize modes, or make mode changes extremely visible _(feedback, color change, confirmation)._

**MISTAKES:** 
the goal or the plan is wrong (i.e., incorrect intention). The user believes they are doing the right thing, but their model is flawed.
